You can easily use multiple clients for the same XMPP account. For example, you can have one on your laptop and one on your mobile phone.

* "Message Archive Management" (MAM) will ensure that all messages are synced to all clients
* "Message Carbons" will ensure that messages are delivered to all clients currently online
* End-to-end encryption with [OMEMO](../omemo/) also easily works in this scenario (see the [tips & tricks](../omemo/#tips--tricks) of OMEMO for proper setup)
