There are {{< external_link "https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html" "many different clients" >}} that can be used for XMPP.

We recommend the following, as they all offer the features you would expect from a modern instant messaging client:

- For Windows: [Gajim](../gajim/)
- For Android: {{< external_link "https://jabber.pix-art.de/" "Pix-Art Messenger" >}} or {{< external_link "https://conversations.im/" "Conversations" >}}
- For iOS: {{< external_link "https://chatsecure.org/" "ChatSecure" >}}
- For Linux: {{< external_link "https://dino.im/" "Dino" >}}
- We also have a [web client](../web_client/) for your browser
- You can also use [multiple clients](../multi_client/)
