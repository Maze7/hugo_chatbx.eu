{{< external_link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP" "XMPP" >}} is a standard for federated instant messaging. *Federated* means that users on one server can chat with users on any other server. This is like e-mail, where you can send e-mails to any other e-mail address, even if the servers (the part behind the `@` sign) are different. An "address" of an XMPP account, the so-called JID or "Jabber ID", even looks like an e-mail address (e.g. `alice@chatbx.eu`). For historical reasons, XMPP is sometimes referred to as "Jabber".

As an open standard, XMPP allows anyone to create and use whatever client and server software they desire and still communicate over the same network. This makes it a great counter against the closed and non-interoperable instant messaging apps that are sadly quite widespread (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.). XMPP puts the users in control: don't like a certain aspect of your client? Use a [different one](../clients/)!

XMPP has all features you expect from a modern instant messaging platform:
- Using [multiple clients/devices](../multi_client/) (e.g. on a phone and a laptop) for the same account with out-of-the-box synchronization
- Sending and receiving of files like photos or voice messages
- Group chats with many participants (open and closed groups)
- A list of contacts/friends and their current online status (if they choose to share it with you)

In terms of security and privacy, XMPP outperforms many of the closed instant messaging apps. All connections between the client and server are encrypted. When enabling [end-to-end encryption](../omemo/), XMPP offers state-of-the-art cryptography that ensures that nobody but the chat partners can read their messages. Due to the decentralized and federated network, one could argue that XMPP is superior to any closed instant messaging app which is run by a single company.

We are convinced by the advantages of XMPP and decided to support the free network by hosting our own XMPP server: chatbx.eu! Anyone is welcome to create an account and join us in this free communication paradise.
