We have a web-client that allows you to chat in your browser. Go to {{< external_link "https://web.chatbx.eu/" >}} to log in.

* The web-client uses {{< external_link "https://conversejs.org/" "Converse.js" >}}
* Just log in with your username (without the `@chatbx.eu`) and password from your registration
* We recommend to disable the "This is a trusted device" checkbox, as otherwise a new [OMEMO](../omemo/) key will be generated and added to your account
