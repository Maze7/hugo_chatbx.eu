This is a brief guide on how to setup an account and start to chat. Want to know what this is all about? [Read about XMPP]({{< relref "xmpp" >}}).

1. Register a new account at: {{< external_link "https://accounts.chatbx.eu/" >}}
	- Note: Your JID ("Jabber ID") will be your username, followed by `@chatbx.eu` (e.g. `alice@chatbx.eu`)
2. Install a [client]({{< relref "clients" >}})
	- Note: You can also use [multiple clients]({{< relref "multi_client" >}})
3. Start the client and log in with the credentials from the account registration
	- Note: If you are unable to connect, you may need a [proxy]({{< relref "proxy" >}})
4. Add your chat contacts to your *roster* (this is your contacts/friends list)
	- This sends a request to see their status (online/offline) and allows them to see yours
	- Note: You can also chat with people that are not in your roster
5. Chat with your contacts
6. Optional: Activate [end-to-end encryption]({{< relref "omemo" >}}) to secure your messages
